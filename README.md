## Solver

A refactoring of the [Sudoku solver notebook](https://github.com/tkuriyama/notebooks/blob/master/ipython/sudoku_revised.ipynb), inspired by Richard Bird's solution in [*Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design*](https://www.amazon.com/Pearls-Functional-Algorithm-Design-Richard/dp/0521513383).

The Python solver records the steps performed in its iterations, to be fed as input into the visualization engine. 

The Elm visualization expects log data as a list of steps, where `type alias Step = { count : Int, action : Action, transform : Transform, stack : Int, score: Int, board : Board }`. Action, Transform, and Board are type aliases defined in `Main.elm`. 

In Python terms, the log consists of a list of dicts, where each dict logs state for a single step in the solver. `solver_logging.py` adds the logging logic to the original solver, ultimately writing the list of dicts to a JSON object with key `model`. 

As an example, `easy.json` logs the iterations of the easy puzzle defined in `solver_logging.py`.

```
âˆš solver % jbro -c 100 easy.json                                                                                    (master)sudoku

      "action": "None",
      "board": [
        [
          0,
          0,
```

## Visualization

The Elm code compiles an SVG visualization of the solver's iterations. 

To (re)compile the visualization, run `elm make src/Main.elm --optimize --output=elm.js` from the visualization directory.

The code assumes that a JSON log file such as `easy.json` is being served at the addressed defined by `url` in `Main.elm`. For one way of testing locally, see [this page](https://elmprogramming.com/decoding-json-part-1.html) for an example of serving using `json-server`.
