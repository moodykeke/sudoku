# JSON Log

The Elm visualization expects log data as a list of steps, where `type alias Step = { count : Int, action : Action, transform : Transform, stack : Int, score: Int, board : Board }`. Action, Transform, and Board are type aliases defined in `Main.elm`. 

In Python terms, the log consists of a list of dicts, where each dict logs state for a single step in the solver. `solver_logging.py` adds the logging logic to the original solver, ultimately writing the list of dicts to a JSON object with key `model`. 

As an example, `easy.json` logs the iterations of the easy puzzle defined in `solver_logging.py`.

```
âˆš solver % jbro -c 100 easy.json                                                                                    (master)sudoku
