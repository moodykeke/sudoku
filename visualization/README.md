# Visualization

## Link


## Elm

To (re)compile the visualization, run `elm make src/Main.elm --optimize --output=elm.js` from the visualization directory.

The code assumes that `test.json` (from the solver directory in this repo) is being served at ``http://localhost:5019/model` (see [this page](http://localhost:5019) for ]an example of serving using `json-server`).
